    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>KaraokeQueueManager is a web-based, database-driven application designed to streamline karaoke events at bars or other venues. This robust tool enables participants to sign up and queue for their turn to sing, while providing DJs with critical information to manage the event seamlessly.

Key Features:

Song Search Capability: Allows users to search for songs by artist, title, or contributor. This ensures that every participant can find their favorite tracks or explore new ones easily.
Dual Queue System: Supports a standard first-come-first-served queue alongside a priority queue, where users can pay to have their songs played sooner.
DJ Interface: Offers a separate, detailed view for the DJ, showing both queues with information on the user, song title, band, and the specific karaoke file to be played.
Dynamic Sorting: Features sortable table columns in the user interface, enhancing the usability during song selection.
Developed using PHP, MariaDB, and enhanced with JavaScript and CSS for a responsive user experience, KaraokeQueueManager is tailored to make karaoke nights more organized and enjoyable for everyone involved.</p>
